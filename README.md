The project focuses on one of the methods of  the sustainable development goals.
If a human mind is rewarded for something it does a task with enthusiasm.With this project we aim to reward people who save electricity and non renewable resources with rewards.
The user has to create the profile and the moment an individual posts their photos of saving electricity or any energy resource, on the website their progress report would be recorded and based on their progress bar we aim to reward them.
The winner would be given fame through social media platforms for saving the electricity or any sources of energy.
This would motivate people to contribute in the name of energy conservation.
Our project would  create a fashion of saving energy where the person who is doing it would be rewarded .
